# Use

Simple dioxus app for skipping/saving dog pictures. Uses an SQLite database to record saved dog picture URLs and then display them under the "favourites" page.
The application is not bundled currently. In order to use it, Rust, dioxus and other prerequisite dependencies will need to be installed. Use `dx serve` to launch the application.
